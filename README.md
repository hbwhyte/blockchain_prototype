# My First Blockchain

An initial blockchain prototype built with Java. Thanks to [@CryptoKass](https://github.com/CryptoKass)
for their awesome tutorial.

This basic blockchain:
 * Stores data in blocks
 * Has an encrypted digital signature that chains the blocks together
 * Requires mining proof of work in order to validate new blocks
 * Validates the hashes to make sure data is unchanged and has been mined
